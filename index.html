   Hi!! This is my portfolio. I'll be modifying this and creating a huge 
   repository of all my projects.

   I work in TCS. I was graduated in year 2020.

   I have worked onfew CLI apps. I will showcase them tomorrow.

   I love harry potter books.


   My favourite hobby is reading books. Some of my friends do gardening in their spare time. Fews are more interested in sports. Some friends want to spend time in music, dance and plays, and films.Books are my ultimate friend. I like spending time with them. Whether it is the mood to increase knowledge or entertainment â€“ they are always available.
